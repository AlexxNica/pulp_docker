2.3 Release Notes
=================

2.3.0
-----

See the :fixedbugs:`2.3.0`.

A new command, ``docker repo tag``, can point tags to manifests. It accepts
``--repo-id``, ``--tag-name``, and ``--manifest-digest``. If a tag with the name
does not exist, it will be created. Any existing tags will be updated and
pointed to the manifest with the supplied digest.
